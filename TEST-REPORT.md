## Known Issues

1. **Widget Editing Inconsistency**:
   - DashboardPage.tsx still references both `WidgetConfigModal` and imports `startConfiguringWidget`
   - `widgetSlice.ts` contains both modal and sidebar approach state

2. **Path Aliasing Issues**:
   - Layout builder components use `@/` path aliases (e.g., in LayoutBuilder.tsx and LayoutControls.tsx)
   - These need to be standardized to relative paths

3. **Potential Widget Edit Sidebar Implementation**:
   - No `WidgetEditSidebar.tsx` file was found, yet it's referenced in code
   - EngineerLayout.tsx may need to implement this sidebar

4. **Missing Edit/Delete Buttons on Widgets**:
   - The requirement for hover buttons on widgets is not yet implemented

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Standardize Widget Editing Approach**:
   - Implement or fix the WidgetEditSidebar component
   - Remove modal-based approach completely (WidgetConfigModal)
   - Update DashboardPage to only use sidebar approach

2. **Fix Import Path Issues**:
   - Replace all `@/` imports with proper relative paths
   - Update MainLayout.tsx imports

3. **Implement Widget Edit/Delete Buttons**:
   - Add buttons that appear on hover to WidgetWrapper.tsx
   - Wire up these buttons to edit and delete actions

4. **Complete RightSidebar for Widget Editing**:
   - Ensure proper integration with Redux
   - Move all widget configuration options to this sidebar

## Test Results

The project has successfully implemented many core requirements, especially those related to the dashboard layout, widget types, and state management. However, there are inconsistencies in the widget editing approach, and some advanced features are not yet implemented.

The most critical issue to address is standardizing the widget editing approach by fully transitioning to the sidebar-based editing (removing the modal approach) and fixing the import path issues to ensure proper building.
